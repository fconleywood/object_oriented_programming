# Let's start by creating two classes: one called Student and another called
# Instructor.
class Student
  def self.learn
    puts "I get it!"
end

class Instructor
  def self.teach
    puts "Everything in Ruby is an Object".
end

# The student class has a method called learn that outputs "I get it!".
# The instructor class has a method called teach that outputs 
# "Everything in Ruby is an Object".
